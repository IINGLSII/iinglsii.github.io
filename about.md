Hello! I'm Nick, an undergrad student interested in pursuing a career as a software engineer within the games industry. I am most interested in gameplay and tools programming because it allows me to give the tools needed for designers and artist to create their vision. I have a strong foundation in C/C++, and 3+ years experience with Unreal Engine!

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
